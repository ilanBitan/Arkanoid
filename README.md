Introduction
As part of an OOP course we were given a task to teach us different elements:

Use of polymorphism and inheritance.
Familiarity with basic design patterns in OOP such as decorator, observer and factory design patterns.
Using java collections and data structures.
Using Java I/O to read and write files(saving the high-scores of players across different games).
Creating game levels based on human-readable text files.
keep open/closed principle states.
Working with GUI.
My Project:
In this project we created a version of the old and familiar game. I added different levels with different difficulties. I also created a file who saves the high-scores of players across different games.
